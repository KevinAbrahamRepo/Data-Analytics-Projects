# Data-Analytics-Projects

Included in this repo are some interesting data manipulation and modelling projects that I worked on over the last few months. All analysis was performed in **python (Jupyter Notebook)**. Below is a brief introduction to each of the projects included. For more information, please go into the sub-folders. Always looking to improve exising code and extend current functionality!  


## Projects using Supervised Learning Models: 

1. Analysis on United Kingdoms road safety and traffic demographics dataset obtained from [UK Traffic Dataset - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/tsiaras/uk-road-safety-accidents-and-vehicles#Accident_Information.csv) with the following key goals: 
    * Identify common factors responsible for higher accident rates through various feature engineering techniques
    * Carry out a restrospective study of the historical dataset and perform descriptive analysis using **Tableau, Power BI and Excel Power Pivot**
    * Attempt to correct an imbalanced target class using **SMOTE, Cluster Centroid, Tomek Links**
    * Perform hyper-paramter tuning using [GridsearchCV](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/grid_search.html) (scikit-learn python package) to enhance predictive power of several supervised learning models (KNN, SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest..)

2. Analyze several thousand tweets collected using [Twitters Streaming API](http://docs.tweepy.org/en/v3.5.0/api.html) in **JSON** format to perform sentiment analysis and classify them into sub categories for a more general consensus. The topic for this NLP project was the 106th **#Greycup/#greycup** held in Edmonton in November, 2018. Key analytic goals:
    * Perform a clean data pull from Twitter and transform data for analysis in python
    * Various descriptive and time series analysis for insights 
    * Build a predictive models to classify sentiment of a tweet (**used textblob library for sentiment analysis**)
