## Classification Objective:

For this Classification task I use the main Bank Marketing dataset. The data is related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe to a term deposit (variable - 'y').

Use both bagging and boosting algorithms to predict variable y (Target Variable). Results are analysed using 3 performance metrics
