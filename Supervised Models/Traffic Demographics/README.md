# Analysis of Road Safety and Traffic Demograhics in UK

For this project, the goal was to help provide recommendations to UKâ€™s department of Transport - to improve road safety policies and prevent accident recurrences where possible. Any implemented suggestions could be tested against the predictive model designed to identify the severity of an accident while taking many factors into account.
