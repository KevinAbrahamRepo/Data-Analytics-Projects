# Natural Language Processing - #GreyCup:


Extract tweets for the **106th Grey Cup** Held in Edmonton on November 25, 2018 and perform sentiment analysis to classify tweets into one of positive, negative or neutral for this subject 

### Use a two pronged approach to collect tweets:
* Gathered tweets from hashtag for Grey Cup - **#greycup**
* Gathered tweets with keywords - **Grey Cup, GreyCup**

*(My functions to collect tweets are based on [Alexander's Blog Post](https://galeascience.wordpress.com/2016/03/18/collecting-twitter-data-with-python/))*
